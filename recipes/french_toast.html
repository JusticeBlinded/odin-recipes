    <h3>Serve with vegan butter.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground flax seeds</li>
        <li>½ cup vanilla soy milk</li>
        <li>¼ (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>6 slices dense bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix boiling water and ground flax seeds together in a bowl; let sit until thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine flax mixture, soy milk, tofu, and nutritional yeast in a blender; blend on high speed until flax has almost disappeared. Add cornstarch while blender is still running and blend until batter is smooth. Pour batter into a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour some of the batter into a shallow bowl or plate. Dip bread, 1 slice at a time, into the batter until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each dipped bread slice in the hot oil for 5 minutes; flip and cook the other side until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
